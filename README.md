### 1. 🧩 Business Problem  
Sales departments often lack a quick, consolidated way to assess employee performance across different cities. Manually compiling sales reports and comparing against targets is inefficient and prone to oversight.


### 2. 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard  
- Visualize total sales and target achievements of employees across cities  
- Identify top performers (high target hit %) and bottom performers (high gap from targets)  
- Provide city-wise filtering for regional analysis  
- Automate user interactions using VBA to save time


### 3. 👀 Walkthrough of Key Visuals  
- **Pivot Tables**: Summarize employee-level sales and performance  
- **Target Hit % Table**: Highlights top 5 employees meeting/exceeding targets  
- **Away from Target % Table**: Shows bottom 5 performers missing their targets  
- **Line Chart**: Visual comparison of Target Hit %  
- **Pie Chart**: Share of bottom performers by percentage gap  
- **VBA Checkbox & Filters**: Dynamically update dashboard based on city selection


### 4. 💡 Business Impact & Insights  
- Enables faster, data-driven evaluations of sales teams  
- Highlights employees who may need support or coaching  
- Improves strategic decision-making by identifying city-wise performance trends  
- Saves time by automating manual filtering tasks through VBA scripting
